# Glossary programme

The glossary programme is building a **user-facing worldwide horse-racing dictionary/knowledge base**. Each usable entry should explain what a racing term means, its Japanese equivalent, where that usage applies, important regional differences, and the evidence supporting the definition.

Search/AI discovery is a later structured layer. It must not distort the dictionary itself.

## Current authority

Read these first for glossary work:

1. [World racing terminology master specification](world-racing-terminology-master-spec.md)
2. [2026-09-09 glossary roadmap addendum](../project-roadmap-2026-09-09-glossary-addendum.md)
3. [Working master data](../../data/glossary-master/README.md)

## Current state in plain language

The working dictionary has **635 terms/concepts**.

- **594 are source-verified at the meaning level**.
- **41 still require review**: verify, narrow regional scope, rewrite, split, merge, or remove.
- the highest-priority core set is **203/203 verified**;
- jurisdiction-specific research additions are **161/161 verified**;
- publication is still disabled (`public_ready=0`, public runtime disconnected).

The latest pass is **targeted residual resolution wave 8**. It verified the current USTA `Freezing` and `Snow` track-condition labels after correcting the seed canonicals, and retired generic `Daylight saving time` as contextual Time zone handling.

Current whole-master coverage is **594/635 verified (93.5%)** with **41 candidates**. Active base seed is **433/474 verified (91.4%)**. SURF is **59/62 verified (95.2%)** and MEET is **37/37 verified (100%)**.

This pass combines current authority terminology with semantic pruning rather than preserving generic or outdated seed labels.

## What has been completed

The dictionary was built from zero rather than copied from the existing public glossary. Major jurisdiction/local-language research and the current slang/abbreviation/historical pass are complete. The core terminology set is fully source-verified, and all current jurisdiction-specific additions are evidence-backed.

Base-dictionary cleanup has now verified **280 additional terms** and removed **22 duplicate, malformed or non-independent rows**. Current base-dictionary coverage is **433/474 verified (91.4%)**.

Canonical evidence/audit files include:

## What remains

The **41 remaining terms** are not all expected to become verified unchanged. Some seed terms are broad, duplicated, polysemous, regional, or badly named. Review means choosing the correct action rather than chasing a percentage.

Targeted residual resolution wave 8 is complete for the current defensible source bundle. The next step is to continue residual cleanup across the remaining base-seed categories while leaving intentionally weak edge cases visible until stronger evidence or a cleaner modeling decision exists.

After that residual cleanup, the evidence/readiness gate will be rerun. `MASTER-006` and public glossary architecture remain blocked until that review is defensible.

## Dictionary modeling rule

```text
find the term in actual racing material
-> determine the exact sense
-> preserve country/region and local-language usage
-> add a source that supports that claim
-> split meanings that are genuinely different
-> merge abbreviations, spelling variants, codes, regional labels, or duplicate identities when appropriate
-> leave uncertain entries under review instead of inventing certainty
```

The existing public glossary remains a disposable runtime baseline and is not the source of truth for this new dictionary.
