# Glossary programme

The glossary programme is building a **user-facing worldwide horse-racing dictionary/knowledge base**. Each usable entry should explain what a racing term means, its Japanese equivalent, where that usage applies, important regional differences, and the evidence supporting the definition.

Search/AI discovery is a later structured layer. It must not distort the dictionary itself.

## Current authority

Read these first for glossary work:

1. [World racing terminology master specification](world-racing-terminology-master-spec.md)
2. [2026-09-09 glossary roadmap addendum](../project-roadmap-2026-09-09-glossary-addendum.md)
3. [Working master data](../../data/glossary-master/README.md)

## Current state in plain language

The working dictionary has **643 terms/concepts**.

- **483 are source-verified at the meaning level**.
- **160 still require review**: verify, narrow regional scope, rewrite, split, merge, or remove.
- the highest-priority core set is **203/203 verified**;
- jurisdiction-specific research additions are **161/161 verified**;
- publication is still disabled (`public_ready=0`, public runtime disconnected).

The current broad **running / trip / race-comment terminology** cleanup is now effectively complete: RUN is **42/44 verified (95.5%)**. The final bundle verified Midfield, Home turn, Stretch run, Run-in, Carried wide, Refused, Ran out, Galloped and Disqualified for gait, and consolidated `Tempo` into `Pace` plus `Kick/closing kick` into `Turn of foot`.

Only two RUN labels remain unresolved: `Jump`, because the seed conflates multiple senses, and `Hold-up horse`, because a strong current authority definition for the exact canonical label has not yet been established.

## What has been completed

The dictionary was built from zero rather than copied from the existing public glossary. Major jurisdiction/local-language research and the current slang/abbreviation/historical pass are complete. The core terminology set is fully source-verified, and all current jurisdiction-specific additions are evidence-backed.

Base-dictionary cleanup has now verified **169 additional terms** and removed **14 duplicate or malformed rows**. Current base-dictionary coverage is **322/482 verified (66.8%)**.

Canonical evidence/audit files include:

```

The abbreviation/code layer remains at **38 source-verified rows**.

## Near-complete categories

- RUN: **42/44 verified (95.5%)** — Jump and Hold-up horse remain candidate.
- MEET: **37/38 verified (97.4%)** — only Daylight saving time remains candidate.
- RESULT: **27/28 verified (96.4%)** — the remaining item is RO/result-code modeling; the RUN event Ran out is now verified.
- BET: **38/39 verified (97.4%)** — American odds remains candidate.
- WELF: **18/18 verified (100%)**.
- PRIZE: **10/12 verified (83.3%)** — Bonus and Stake remain candidate.

## What remains

The **160 remaining terms** are not all expected to become verified unchanged. Some seed terms are broad, duplicated, polysemous, regional, or badly named. Review means choosing the correct action rather than chasing a percentage.

The next broad cleanup target is **equipment and training terminology**. After that come horse/breeding/roles, venue/entry, and the remaining race type/surface/distance/weight candidates. The two unresolved RUN labels and other residual edge cases stay visible for later evidence-driven resolution rather than blocking work on clearer categories.

After that cleanup, the evidence/readiness gate will be rerun. `MASTER-006` and public glossary architecture remain blocked until that review is defensible.

## Dictionary modeling rule

```text
find the term in actual racing material
-> determine the exact sense
-> preserve country/region and local-language usage
-> add a source that supports that claim
-> split meanings that are genuinely different
-> merge abbreviations, spelling variants, codes, regional labels, or duplicate identities when appropriate
-> leave uncertain entries under review instead of inventing certainty
```

The existing public glossary remains a disposable runtime baseline and is not the source of truth for this new dictionary.
