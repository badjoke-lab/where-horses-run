# Glossary programme

The glossary programme is building a **user-facing worldwide horse-racing dictionary/knowledge base**. Each usable entry should explain what a racing term means, its Japanese equivalent, where that usage applies, important regional differences, and the evidence supporting the definition.

Search/AI discovery is a later structured layer. It must not distort the dictionary itself.

## Current authority

Read these first for glossary work:

1. [World racing terminology master specification](world-racing-terminology-master-spec.md)
2. [2026-09-09 glossary roadmap addendum](../project-roadmap-2026-09-09-glossary-addendum.md)
3. [Working master data](../../data/glossary-master/README.md)

## Current state in plain language

The working dictionary has **648 terms/concepts**.

- **442 are source-verified at the meaning level**.
- **206 still require review**: verify, narrow regional scope, rewrite, split, merge, or remove.
- the highest-priority core set is **203/203 verified**;
- jurisdiction-specific research additions are **161/161 verified**;
- publication is still disabled (`public_ready=0`, public runtime disconnected).

The latest completed subject pass is **prize money / betting / odds terminology**. It verified six prize/value Concepts and 22 betting Concepts. PRIZE is now **10/12 verified** and BET is **35/39 verified**.

The wager model was also cleaned up. `Forecast / Straight Forecast` is preserved as a regional label for the exact-order `Exacta` mechanic where applicable; `Reverse Forecast / Dual Forecast` resolves to `Quinella`; `Tricast / Tierce` resolves to `Trifecta`. Those regional labels are no longer duplicate wager Concepts. `Bonus`, `Stake`, `Totalisator`, `Fractional odds`, `American odds` and `On the board` remain deliberately unresolved.

## What has been completed

The dictionary was built from zero rather than copied from the existing public glossary. Major jurisdiction/local-language research and the current slang/abbreviation/historical pass are complete. The core terminology set is fully source-verified, and all current jurisdiction-specific additions are evidence-backed.

Base-dictionary cleanup has now verified **128 additional terms** and removed **9 duplicate or malformed rows**. Current base-dictionary coverage is **281/487 verified (57.7%)**.

Canonical evidence/audit files include:

data/glossary-master/coverage/master-005-evidence-coverage-v1.tsv
data/glossary-master/coverage/master-005-completion-gate-v1.tsv
```

The abbreviation/code layer remains at **38 source-verified rows**; this pass moved regional wager names through dispositions/labels rather than inflating the abbreviation layer.

## What remains

The **206 remaining terms** are not all expected to become verified unchanged. Some seed terms are broad, duplicated, polysemous, regional, or badly named. Review means choosing the correct action rather than chasing a percentage.

The next practical groups are:

```text
welfare / veterinary / safety terminology
remaining result / prize / betting / surface / meeting edge cases when stronger evidence exists
remaining ambiguous terms and duplicate cleanup
```

After those groups are reviewed, the evidence/readiness gate will be rerun. Only then should public glossary architecture, search intent, SEO/AI-discovery projection, and rollout be considered.

## Dictionary modeling rule

```text
find the term in actual racing material
-> determine the exact sense
-> preserve country/region and local-language usage
-> add a source that supports that claim
-> split meanings that are genuinely different
-> merge abbreviations, spelling variants, codes, regional labels, or duplicate identities when appropriate
-> leave uncertain entries under review instead of inventing certainty
```

The existing public glossary remains a disposable runtime baseline and is not the source of truth for this new dictionary.
